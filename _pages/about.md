Hi! I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the [Development Innovation Lab](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/development-innovation-lab/), part of the Becker Friedman Institute at the University of Chicago.

I earnt my PhD (DPhil) at the [Department of Economics](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford.

My research interests are in development, labour, and behavioural economics. I use randomised and natural experiments to help answer policy questions.
My current research studies firm and household behaviour in low-income rural settings.

I am also affiliated with the [Bissau Economics Lab](https://www.bissaueconomicslab.com/), the [Centre for the Study of African Economies](https://www.csae.ox.ac.uk/), and the [Mind and Behaviour Research Group](https://mbrg.bsg.ox.ac.uk/).

  <summary><b>Impact of Market Information on Cashew Producers in Guinea-Bissau</b><br>
  <i>with Brais Álvarez Pereira, Adewusi Mendonça, Dayvikson Raiss Laval Tavares, Sebastian Schäber</i>
</summary>
  <br>
  <p><i>Abstract:</i> Does providing market information to smallholder farmers increase their income? To answer this question, we ran a two-level cluster randomized controlled trial among 1988 cashew producers in 290 villages in Guinea-Bissau. Treated producers received free weekly messages to their mobiles during the trading seasons in 2020 and 2021. The messages provided up-to-date market news, farmgate prices, and gave sales advice. We found that treated producers reported higher prices, mostly during the 2021 season. Treated producers sold their cashews more frequently relative to the other producers, who tend to sell their cashews in a single transaction. We explore several mechanisms to understand our results. We find evidence consistent with information increasing the bargaining power of treated producers, who negotiate better sale deals. Moreover, we find that treated producers also changed the timing of their sales to smooth their income over time. We found no evidence of changes in preferences, or increased salience of transactions as a result of the information sent to treated producers. Given the low cost of our intervention, market information can be a cost-effective tool to increase producers’ revenues.   </p>

  <summary><b>Labour Market Effects of Ethiopia's Social Safety Net</b></summary>
    <br>
  <p><i>Abstract:</i>  This  paper assesses how a large transfer programme combining public works and unconditional transfers to food-insecure households in rural Ethiopia affects local labour markets. Using  repeated cross-sections of the National Labour Force Survey, I show that the programme did not change employment rates or wages in this rural economy. Instead, I find that workers shifted from agricultural to non-agricultural self-employment. I complement this analysis using  data from the Ethiopian Socio-Economic surveys and find similar results.  These results are at odds with previous work due to the thinness of rural wage markets in Ethiopia.</p>

  <summary><b>The Future in Mind: Aspirations and Long-term Outcomes in Rural Ethiopia</b><br>
  <i>with Tanguy Bernard, Stefan Dercon, Kate Orkin, Alemayehu Seyoum Taffesse</i></summary>
    <br>
  <p><i>Abstract:</i>  Aspirations have been posited to condition the future-oriented choices of individuals and thus can play a role in the persistence of poverty or the effort to break out of it. In a randomised control trial in remote, rural Ethiopia, we assess the effectiveness of an intervention seeking to change how poor people perceive their future opportunities, alter their aspirations and, through that, modify their investment decisions. A treatment group was shown video documentaries about the lives of individuals from similar communities who escaped poverty through their own efforts and, as such, can serve as role models. Five years after the screening took place, the treated households increased future-oriented investments in agriculture and in children's education. The results can be explained by the increase in aspirations in terms of lifetime goals. Overall, this research uniquely provides evidence that a light-touch behavioural intervention can have persistent economic impacts on a poor population.</p>
